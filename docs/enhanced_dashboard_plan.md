# RVF-Nextstrain Enhanced Dashboard Implementation Plan

This document provides a summary and roadmap for implementing the enhanced dashboard features required for the RVF-Nextstrain project.

## 1. RVF-Specific Visualizations

### Priority Components

1. **Segment Comparison View**

   - Development Timeline: 2-3 weeks
   - Key Dependencies: Metadata standardization for segment identification
   - Implementation Approach: Custom React component for side-by-side tree comparison

2. **Outbreak Clustering Dashboard**
   - Development Timeline: 3-4 weeks
   - Key Dependencies: Metadata needs to include outbreak identifiers or temporal-geographic clustering
   - Implementation Approach: D3.js-based clustering visualization with linkage to main Auspice view

### Implementation Roadmap

**Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-2)**

- Create visualization specification documents
- Implement data processing scripts to prepare segment-specific datasets
- Develop prototype of Segment Comparison View

**Phase 2: Integration (Weeks 3-4)**

- Connect custom visualizations to Auspice data structure
- Implement synchronized navigation between views
- Develop basic outbreak clustering algorithm

**Phase 3: Refinement (Weeks 5-6)**

- User testing and feedback collection
- Performance optimization
- Integration with main dashboard

## 2. Server-Side Caching

### Implementation Components

1. **File-Based Caching System**

   - Status: Ready for implementation
   - Priority: High
   - Dependencies: None

2. **API Server**

   - Status: Ready for implementation
   - Priority: High
   - Dependencies: File-based caching system

3. **Nginx Configuration**
   - Status: Ready for implementation
   - Priority: Medium
   - Dependencies: API server deployment

### Deployment Plan

**Stage 1: Development Setup**

- Implement file-based caching system
- Test API server locally
- Benchmark performance improvements

**Stage 2: Staging Deployment**

- Deploy API server to staging environment
- Configure Nginx with caching settings
- Load test with simulated traffic

**Stage 3: Production Deployment**

- Deploy to production environment
- Configure monitoring and alerts
- Implement cache purging on new data uploads

## 3. Embedding Capabilities

### Implementation Priority

1. **Basic iframe Embedding**

   - Status: Ready for implementation
   - Priority: High
   - Dependencies: None

2. **Component-Based Embedding**

   - Status: Design complete, implementation pending
   - Priority: Medium
   - Dependencies: Auspice components library extraction

3. **API-Based Integration**
   - Status: Design complete, implementation pending
   - Priority: Low
   - Dependencies: API server deployment

### Feature Rollout

**Phase 1: Basic Embedding (Month 1)**

- Implement iframe embedding with URL parameter support
- Document embedding options in README and docs
- Create simple examples for common use cases

**Phase 2: Component Library (Month 2)**

- Extract reusable components from Auspice
- Develop embed.js library
- Create documentation with code examples

**Phase 3: Partner Integration (Month 3)**

- Work with 2-3 partner institutions to pilot embeddings
- Refine API based on integration feedback
- Create showcase of embedded use cases

## Resource Requirements

1. **Development Resources**

   - 1 Front-end developer with React/D3.js experience (3 months)
   - 1 Back-end developer for API and caching system (1 month)
   - 1 DevOps engineer for deployment configuration (part-time)

2. **Infrastructure**

   - Web server with 4+ CPU cores, 8+ GB RAM
   - CDN for static assets and cached JSON files
   - 100+ GB storage for caching multiple dataset versions

3. **Testing**
   - Load testing tools (e.g., Apache JMeter)
   - Browser testing across multiple platforms
   - Performance profiling tools

## Next Steps

1. Prioritize implementation of server-side caching for immediate performance benefits
2. Begin development of the Segment Comparison View as the highest-priority RVF-specific visualization
3. Implement basic iframe embedding to support immediate sharing needs
4. Schedule regular reviews of dashboard usage metrics to identify high-demand features

This implementation plan provides a comprehensive roadmap for enhancing the RVF-Nextstrain dashboard with custom visualizations, performance optimizations through caching, and flexible embedding capabilities.
