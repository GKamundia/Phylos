Below is a concise overview of the main challenges you’ll face when building an automated Rift Valley Fever (RVF) dashboard with Nextstrain data—and concrete recommendations to overcome them.

Summary
Building a real-time RVF dashboard entails (1) sourcing and curating sequence data, (2) enforcing strict metadata standards, (3) running and maintaining the Nextstrain build pipeline, (4) automating updates on a schedule, (5) providing sufficient compute and storage, and (6) integrating the resulting JSON into an interactive dashboard. Key pitfalls include inconsistent metadata (dates, locations), pipeline failures due to dependency or data errors, scheduler misconfigurations, and scaling bottlenecks. Remedies involve schema validation, containerization, CI/CD with GitHub Actions or cron workflows, monitoring/logging, and modular dashboard design with cached JSON.

1. Data Availability & Integration
   Challenge: Public RVF genomes may be scattered across GenBank or specific repos, with uneven coverage by region and date.
   GitHub

Remedy:

Mirror official GenBank queries in your ingest step (e.g., via Entrez).
GitHub

Maintain your own curated sequence archive (e.g., S3 bucket) to avoid surprises when upstream records change.
GitHub

2. Metadata Formatting & Validation
   Challenge:

Dates often mis-formatted (e.g. Excel auto-conversion).
docs.nextstrain.org

Missing or non-standardized location fields break Nextstrain’s geospatial mapping.
docs.nextstrain.org

Remedy:

Define a strict TSV schema (using pandas or JSON Schema) and validate each run.
docs.nextstrain.org

Use Nextclade or custom scripts to enforce date format YYYY-MM-DD and to fill missing latitude/longitude from ISO country codes.
docs.nextstrain.org

3. Bioinformatics Pipeline Stability
   Challenge:

Upstream dependency changes (Augur, Auspice, MAFFT) can break your Snakefile.
docs.nextstrain.org

Occasional poor-quality or chimeric sequences cause alignment or tree-building failures.
BioMed Central

Remedy:

Containerize with Docker (pin versions in Dockerfile) to guarantee reproducibility.
GitHub

Integrate a QC step (Nextclade) to filter out low-coverage or outlier sequences before alignment.
docs.nextstrain.org

4. Automation & Scheduling
   Challenge:

Ensuring builds run reliably on your schedule (daily/weekly/monthly) without manual intervention.
subramanyarao.hashnode.dev

Remedy:

Use GitHub Actions with scheduled workflows (cron syntax) to trigger nextstrain build at your chosen interval.
GitHub

Alternatively, deploy a lightweight VM or container that runs a cron job to invoke nextstrain build and commit results.
subramanyarao.hashnode.dev

5. Infrastructure & Scalability
   Challenge:

Phylogenetic inference and alignment can be CPU- and memory-intensive as your dataset grows.
MDPI

Storing multi-segment RVF JSON outputs and serving them to dashboards can tax disk I/O.
Remedy:

Leverage cloud batch services (AWS Batch or Google Cloud Batch) for compute-intensive steps, autoscaling worker nodes.
docs.nextstrain.org

Store artifacts in S3 (or equivalent) with lifecycle policies, and serve via CDN for low-latency dashboard loading.

6. Dashboard Integration & Visualization
   Challenge:

Mapping the exported Auspice JSON into a bespoke dashboard requires parsing complex nested structures (trees, maps).
Remedy:

Embed Auspice’s React components directly for phylogeny and map panels, or convert JSON into a simplified format for D3/Deck.gl.
GitHub

Cache parsed data in a backend (e.g., Node.js or Flask) to avoid re-parsing on each user visit.

Recommendations & Best Practices
Version Control Everything:

Store your pathogen repo—including Snakefile, config YAML, and metadata schema—in Git.
GitHub

Comprehensive Testing:

Add unit tests for metadata validators and smoke tests for the full pipeline in CI.
docs.nextstrain.org

Monitoring & Alerts:

Integrate notifications (Slack, email) for build failures or QC anomalies.

Documentation & Onboarding:

Maintain a README with clear instructions on how to set up, run, and troubleshoot your RVF build—mirroring Nextstrain’s own docs.
docs.nextstrain.org

Stakeholder Feedback Loop:

Regularly validate that the dashboard meets epidemiologists’ needs (e.g., specific filters, outbreak alerts).

By anticipating these issues and applying robust automation plus validation, you’ll have a self-updating, scalable RVF dashboard that stakeholders can rely on for timely insights.

Kindly research the biggest bottleneck when it comes to using NextStrain Augur and Auspice

Show thinking
When using Nextstrain's Augur and Auspice components, users may encounter different types of bottlenecks. These can range from computational demands and data handling for Augur, to visualization performance for Auspice, especially with large datasets.

Augur Bottlenecks (Bioinformatics Processing)
Augur is the part of the Nextstrain toolkit responsible for bioinformatics analysis, including sequence alignment, phylogenetic tree construction, and ancestral state reconstruction. Potential bottlenecks include:

Computational Resources and Processing Time:
Phylogenetic analyses, particularly for large datasets with many sequences, are inherently computationally intensive. Steps like sequence alignment (often using external tools like MAFFT) and maximum likelihood tree inference (e.g., with IQ-TREE) can require significant CPU time and memory. While Augur streamlines these processes, the underlying computational demand remains a factor.  
Data Preparation and Management:
Input Data Quality and Format: Ensuring that input sequences (FASTA files) and metadata (TSV files) are correctly formatted and free of errors is crucial. Issues in the input data can lead to errors or unexpected results in the Augur pipeline.  
Workflow Complexity and Customization: Augur is designed as a modular toolkit, allowing for flexible workflow construction. However, setting up, customizing, and debugging these workflows, especially for new pathogens or specific research questions, can be complex and time-consuming. Understanding how different Augur sub-commands interact and integrate with external tools is key.  
Dependency Management: Augur relies on several external bioinformatics programs (e.g., MAFFT, IQ-TREE). Installing and managing these dependencies correctly across different systems can sometimes be a hurdle.  
Analysis and Interpretation:
As highlighted in a review on genomic surveillance, the analysis and interpretation of genomic data can be complex and resource-intensive, requiring specialized bioinformatics expertise (Genomic surveillance for tackling emerging plant diseases, with special reference to wheat blast | CABI Reviews). Augur aims to make these analyses more accessible, but understanding the nuances of phylogenetic inference and interpreting the results still requires careful consideration.
Auspice Bottlenecks (Visualization)
Auspice is the interactive visualization component of Nextstrain, typically run in a web browser. The most significant bottleneck for Auspice is related to performance with large datasets.

Performance with Large Datasets:
Auspice can experience slowdowns when visualizing very large phylogenetic trees (many thousands of tips/nodes), especially when combined with extensive metadata, diverse genomes (affecting entropy calculations), and complex geographic data.  
The Nextstrain team has explicitly acknowledged this: "It remains a consistent frustration to have phylogenetic analyses limited to ~5000 samples. This limitation is largely due to JavaScript performance of manipulating thousands of SVG objects." (Nextstrain Annual Update March 2024).  
Performance improvements are an ongoing effort. For example, entropy calculations are skipped when the panel is off-screen, and animations are disabled for operations on trees with over 4,000 tips to enhance responsiveness (Notable changes in Auspice - Nextstrain).
Discussions on GitHub also reflect challenges and ongoing work related to performance with large trees and identify SVG rendering and multiple tree traversals during animation as key areas (Request for performance audit #955 - nextstrain/auspice - GitHub).
Browser and Environment Factors:
Occasionally, external factors like browser extensions can interfere with Auspice's performance, leading to slowness or unresponsiveness. For instance, a past issue was noted with the 1Password browser extension (Auspice slow/unresponsive with latest 1Password browser extension - Nextstrain). While specific issues are often resolved, it highlights that the browser environment can impact Auspice.  
User Interface and Interactivity for Complex Views:
While powerful, interactively navigating and comprehending very large and dense visualizations can be challenging. The Nextstrain team continually works on improving UI/UX, including features for filtering and focusing on specific data subsets.
In summary, for Augur, bottlenecks often relate to the computational demands of large-scale bioinformatics analyses and the complexities of workflow and data management. For Auspice, the primary bottleneck is rendering and interaction performance when dealing with very large phylogenetic datasets in a web browser environment. The Nextstrain team actively works on addressing these limitations and improving the tools.

Auspice: An Open-source Interactive Tool for Visualising Phylogenomic Data

docs.nextstrain.org

I want to build a dashboard on Rift Valley Fever.

I want to also automate the process so that the dashboard automatically updates its records after a specified period e.g. 1 day, 1 week, a month etc

This would require that the process for Data preparation and Metadata Formatting to be automated too. Kindly explore the issues related and that I would also experience when building this dashboard and then recommend remedies.

Show thinking
Building an automated dashboard for Rift Valley Fever (RVF) using Nextstrain is an ambitious and valuable project. It involves several key stages, each with potential challenges and solutions. Here's an exploration of the issues you might encounter and recommendations for addressing them:

I. General Steps to Build an Automated RVF Dashboard with Nextstrain:

Establish Data Sources: Identify reliable sources for RVF genomic sequences and associated metadata (e.g., NCBI GenBank, collaborations with veterinary and public health labs).
Develop an Ingest Workflow: Create scripts to automatically fetch new data from your chosen sources. This workflow will also perform initial cleaning, validation, and transformation of metadata into a standardized format Nextstrain can use.
Create a Pathogen-Specific Nextstrain Build for RVF:
Start with the nextstrain/pathogen-repo-guide to structure your repository.
Develop a Snakefile that defines all the steps for your RVF analysis using augur commands:
Indexing and filtering sequences.
Aligning sequences (considering RVF's segmented genome – you might need to decide on analyzing segments separately or concatenated, or focus on one).
Building a phylogenetic tree.
Refining the tree with temporal and geographic data.
Inferring ancestral traits, sequences, and mutations.
Exporting the results into JSON format for Auspice.
Customize Auspice Visualization: Tailor the Auspice interface for RVF, defining color schemes for locations, hosts, clades, etc., and setting up the map and other panels appropriately.
Automate the Entire Pipeline:
Use a workflow manager like Snakemake (which is standard for Nextstrain builds) to orchestrate all steps from data fetching to Auspice JSON generation.
Schedule the automated execution of this Snakemake workflow using tools like cron on a server or GitHub Actions if your project is hosted on GitHub.
Set Up Dashboard Hosting: Decide how the Auspice dashboard will be served (e.g., on a dedicated web server, as part of a static site, or potentially through Nextstrain Groups if applicable).
II. Issues and Remedies: Automated Data Preparation and Metadata Formatting

This is often the most challenging part of automating a genomic surveillance pipeline.

Issue: Data Availability and Sporadic Submission

Problem: RVF sequence data in public repositories like GenBank might be submitted sporadically, with varying levels of completeness and quality. There isn't a centralized, highly curated database like GISAID for RVF.
Remedy:
Implement robust scripts (e.g., Python with Biopython and NCBI Entrez utilities, or the ncbi-datasets command-line tool) to regularly query and download available RVF data.
Apply strict initial filters based on sequence length, N-content, and completeness of essential metadata (e.g., collection date, country).
Advocate for and collaborate with data generators to encourage timely submission of high-quality sequences and metadata using standardized formats.
Issue: Inconsistent and Incomplete Metadata

Problem: Metadata from different sources or labs often lacks standardization in field names, location naming, date formats, host names, etc. Critical information might be missing.
Remedy: Leverage Nextstrain's ingest workflow capabilities and augur tools:
Standardize Fields: Use mapping files or scripts to rename diverse source metadata fields to Nextstrain's expected fields (e.g., strain, virus, date, country, division, location, host).
Normalize Values:
Location: Develop a curated list of RVF-relevant geographic names and their corresponding administrative levels (country, division, location). Use Nextstrain's geolocation rules (you can add custom rules in ingest/defaults/geolocation_rules.tsv or a similar file) to assign latitudes and longitudes. Be prepared to handle variations in spelling and administrative divisions.
Dates: Parse various date formats (e.g., DD/MM/YYYY, MM/DD/YY, YYYY-Mon-DD) into the ISO standard YYYY-MM-DD. Implement logic for handling partial dates (e.g., YYYY-MM-XX, YYYY-XX-XX) if necessary, though complete dates are preferred.
Host: Standardize host names (e.g., "Bos taurus", "Ovis aries", "Homo sapiens", specific mosquito vector species).
Strain Names: Ensure strain names are unique and informative. Define a consistent naming convention if possible, or use GenBank accessions as a stable backup. The curate.strain_backup_fields parameter in an ingest configuration can be useful.
Curation Scripts: For complex transformations beyond simple mapping, write custom Python scripts to be integrated into your Snakemake ingest workflow. The Nextstrain ncov-ingest repository (though complex and not for direct reuse) offers examples of such curation logic.
Data Validation: Implement checks at each step to ensure data conforms to expected formats and values. Log errors and excluded records.
Issue: Handling RVF's Segmented Genome

Problem: RVF virus has three RNA segments (L, M, S). You'll need to decide how to handle this for phylogenetic analysis.
Remedy:
Your data fetching and preparation pipeline must be able to identify and group sequences belonging to the same sample but different segments if that information is available.
Decide on an analytical strategy:
Analyze a single, most informative segment (e.g., L or M segment).
Perform separate analyses for each segment.
Concatenate segments for a whole-genome phylogeny (ensure appropriate partitioning in tree-building).
The Snakemake workflow will need rules to accommodate this (e.g., separate processing paths per segment, then a combination step if needed). The Nextstrain seasonal-flu workflow (analyzing HA and NA) might offer structural parallels.
Issue: Data Quality Control

Problem: Automated pipelines can inadvertently include low-quality sequences (e.g., too short, too many ambiguous bases, contamination).
Remedy:
Implement augur filter steps with stringent criteria (e.g., min length, max Ns).
Optionally, integrate tools like Nextclade for quality control, clade assignment, and mutation calling as part of your ingest or pre-filter workflow. Nextclade can provide QC metrics that you can use for filtering.
III. Issues and Remedies: Automating the Entire Nextstrain Workflow

Issue: Scheduling and Orchestration

Problem: Ensuring the entire pipeline (data fetch, ingest, Augur analysis, Auspice JSON update) runs reliably at specified intervals.
Remedy:
Snakemake: Define the entire end-to-end process as a Snakemake workflow. This handles dependencies between steps and facilitates reproducibility.
Scheduling:
cron: A standard Unix utility to schedule jobs on a server. You can create a cron job to execute your nextstrain build . or snakemake command.
GitHub Actions: If your codebase is on GitHub, use GitHub Actions to trigger your workflow on a schedule (schedule event) or upon specific events (e.g., updates to data fetching scripts). Nextstrain's own builds often use GitHub Actions.
Issue: Error Handling, Logging, and Notifications

Problem: Automated pipelines can fail for various reasons (network issues, changes in data source format, bugs in scripts, resource limits).
Remedy:
Robust Scripting: Write defensive code with good error checking, especially in data fetching and parsing scripts.
Snakemake Error Handling: Snakemake will stop on errors. Ensure logs are captured.
Logging: Implement comprehensive logging for each step. Snakemake creates logs, but custom scripts should also log their actions, warnings, and errors.
Notifications: Set up automated notifications (e.g., email, Slack) for pipeline failures or critical warnings. This allows for quick intervention.
Issue: Computational Resources

Problem: Regularly running phylogenetic analyses can be computationally demanding, especially as the dataset grows.
Remedy:
Efficient Workflow: Optimize your Snakemake rules and scripts.
Adequate Hardware: Run the pipeline on a server or cloud instance with sufficient CPU cores, RAM, and disk space.
Subsampling: Implement an automated subsampling strategy within augur filter (e.g., based on recency, geographic diversity, or lineage representation) to keep the dataset size manageable for routine updates, while perhaps running larger, more comprehensive analyses less frequently.
Issue: Data and Software Versioning for Reproducibility

Problem: Ensuring that analyses are reproducible and that you can trace back results to specific data inputs and software versions.
Remedy:
Git: Use Git to version control all your workflow scripts (Snakefile, Python scripts, config files).
Software Environments: Use Conda or Docker (managed by nextstrain-cli) to ensure consistent software versions (Augur, Auspice, and their dependencies). Document these environments.
Data Versioning: For critical input data (especially fetched raw data and curated metadata), consider a strategy for versioning or archiving (e.g., storing dated copies, or using specialized data versioning tools if the scale demands it). Output JSONs from Auspice should also be versioned or archived.
Issue: Updating the Dashboard Display

Problem: Ensuring the web-facing dashboard correctly reflects the latest analysis results.
Remedy:
The final step of your automated Snakemake workflow should place the newly generated Auspice JSON files in the directory from which your web server serves them.
If using a static site generator, the automation should trigger a rebuild of the site.
Ensure file permissions are correct and the web server is configured to pick up the new files.
Issue: Initial Development and Maintenance Overhead

Problem: Setting up a fully automated pipeline for a new pathogen is a significant undertaking and requires ongoing maintenance as data sources, software, or scientific understanding evolves.
Remedy:
Start Simple, Iterate: Begin with a manual or semi-automated workflow for RVF. Gradually automate each component.
Leverage Existing Nextstrain Resources: Thoroughly study the Nextstrain documentation, tutorials (especially "Creating a phylogenetic workflow" and the "pathogen-repo-guide"), and the structure of existing pathogen builds.
Community Support: Engage with the Nextstrain community discussion forum for advice.
Dedicated Effort: Recognize that this requires dedicated time for development and ongoing monitoring and updates.
By anticipating these challenges and implementing robust solutions, you can build a powerful and sustainable automated dashboard for Rift Valley Fever surveillance using Nextstrain. Good luck!
