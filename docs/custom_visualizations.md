# Custom Visualization Components for RVF-Nextstrain

This document outlines specialized visualization components that could enhance the RVF-specific dashboard beyond standard Auspice panels.

## Potential RVF-Specific Visualization Components

### 1. Segment Comparison View

**Purpose:** Enable side-by-side comparison of evolutionary patterns across RVF's three genomic segments (L, M, S)

**Implementation Options:**

- Direct integration with Auspice using custom JavaScript
- External view using Auspice JSONs processed by D3.js
- Implementation through Nextstrain's "narratives" feature

**Key Features:**

- Synchronized timeline controls
- Highlighting of reassortment events (where segments show different evolutionary histories)
- Tabbed interface for switching between segments
- Combined view showing segment-specific trees in parallel panels

### 2. Vector-Host Transmission Network

**Purpose:** Visualize the interactions between mosquito vectors and mammalian hosts

**Implementation Options:**

- Force-directed graph using D3.js
- Sankey diagram showing transmission flows
- Integration with the map panel via custom layers

**Key Features:**

- Edge thickness representing transmission frequency
- Color coding by host/vector groups
- Temporal filtering to show transmission patterns over time
- Toggle between species-level and group-level views

### 3. Outbreak Clustering Dashboard

**Purpose:** Group sequences by outbreak events and visualize epidemiological relationships

**Implementation Options:**

- Custom grid layout showing outbreak clusters
- Timeline with outbreak markers
- Heatmap showing genetic similarity between outbreaks

**Key Features:**

- Automatic clustering of sequences by time, geography, and genetic similarity
- Drill-down capability to explore individual outbreaks
- Integration with external case count data if available
- Export functionality for outbreak reports

### 4. Veterinary Impact Indicators

**Purpose:** Visualize the impact of RVF on livestock populations

**Implementation Options:**

- Choropleth maps showing livestock cases
- Dashboard widgets showing key metrics
- Time-series charts of veterinary impacts

**Key Features:**

- Integration with livestock population data
- Overlay of sequence data with veterinary case reports
- Economic impact estimates where data is available
- Filter by livestock type (cattle, sheep, goats)

## Technical Implementation Considerations

1. **Data Requirements:**

   - Host metadata must be standardized with consistent taxonomy
   - Location data needs high-quality geocoding
   - Temporal data for outbreak association
   - Segment identification must be accurate and complete

2. **Development Approach:**

   - Phase 1: Build as separate views accessing the same underlying dataset
   - Phase 2: Integrate with main Auspice interface through custom extensions
   - Phase 3: Create standalone components for embedding

3. **Prioritization:**
   - Segment Comparison View (highest priority due to RVF's segmented genome)
   - Outbreak Clustering Dashboard (high epidemiological value)
   - Vector-Host Transmission Network (dependent on metadata quality)
   - Veterinary Impact Indicators (if livestock data available)

## Next Steps

1. Evaluate quality and completeness of current metadata for supporting these visualizations
2. Prototype the Segment Comparison View as a proof-of-concept
3. Gather feedback from RVF researchers on visualization priorities
4. Select development technology (D3.js, React, or other visualization libraries)
