Coding standards, domain knowledge, and preferences that AI should follow.

1. Use your tools. DO NOT GUESS!
2. Keep going until the job is completely solved before ending your turn.
3. If you are unsure about code or files, open them- do not hallucinate.
4. Plan thoroughly before every tool call and reflect on the outcome after.
5. Use the correct file extension for the code generated and reference the file in the response.
